Import .midi file
Input from user the offset of the first timing point
Create a list with all the timestamps of notes
    if notes are within 25ms from the first note of the pair, combine as 1 timestamp on the first note
For each two timestamps, execute the timingPoint.py
    input tuple with the two ms values of where the two timestamps are at
    find difference between the two values
    using range of possible differences, go in this order:
    1/2, 1/4, 1/3, 1/6
    ex: between 50ms-100ms=1/4
    Return a bpm (and/or a boolean stating whether it was a bpm for only the first two or all three points)

BASICALLY THE SAME THING BUT INSTEAD DO A TUPLE OF 3
WE CAN TEST BOTH OPTIONS AND SEE WHICH ONE WORKS BETTER

Loop using timingPoint.py and +=1 the i value that limits number of times to loop and also used for indexing.
Every time the timing point is returned, add it to a list
Once the list is completed, export the timing points in .osu format (in a .txt file)
